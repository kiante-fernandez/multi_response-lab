This repository contains code for the experiment that is replicating https://select-multi-options.herokuapp.com/. The aim of this experiment is to first gather the subject’s ratings of the 60 foods, and then of their top rated foods, have 3 blocks of selecting foods. One block asks them to choose 1 food out of 4, another block asks them to choose 2 foods out of 4 and the last block asks them to choose 3 foods out of 4. The order in which these blocks will be presented is randomized. An eye tracker will also be used during the option selecting phase.
